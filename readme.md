## About _Metric Tank_

Metric Tank is is an application for collecting user metrics from video games, although it can be used with any piece of software.

Besides providing an API and a database, it also provides a visual interface for inspecting and comparing data between different users, builds, settings and even between different applications.

## Notice

Metric Tank is not production-ready software in any shape or form. Until version 1.0.0 is released,
breaking changes can and will be introduced. It is therefore **NOT** recommended to use in a production environment.
